### A user path 
When user access my app: 
1. First step is that my app will goes to (/) route, and then
this route requires authorization,so redirects to /login.

2. Step two is login will redirect to authorization server which is KC.

3. After i am auth in (KC) i will (the user), redirect back to (/) 
which is displaying a plain html with a welcome message,
and a button to fetch resources from the microservise 
running on a different infrustructure.

### Step 1: User Visits Login Page

**URL:**
```
http://localhost:8080/realms/news_books_realm/protocol/openid-connect/auth?response_type=code&client_id=news_books_client&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A5000%2Fauthorize&scope=openid+email+profile&state=hqj9ldaSfEbnKV1ex0IlzYBHfPdwXo&nonce=Cp4JocrgYLV9ABT5yr4n
```

- **Issuer:** The web application running on `localhost:5000` redirects the user to the Keycloak server (`localhost:8080`), which handles authentication for the `news_books_realm`.
  
- **Purpose:** This URL initiates the OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication process. The client (`news_books_client`) requests an authorization code (`response_type=code`). This code will be exchanged later for an access token. The `redirect_uri` parameter specifies where the user should be redirected after successful authentication, and `scope` defines the level of access (like `openid`, `email`, `profile`).

- **Expected Response:** Keycloak will prompt the user for credentials if they are not already logged in.

### Step 2: User Submits Credentials

The user enters credentials and clicks the "Login" button. This triggers a POST request to authenticate the user.

**URL:**
```
http://localhost:8080/realms/news_books_realm/login-actions/authenticate?session_code=CWFAG9GHwWonrOUWsambpsoK2ulWwCh2FjpMmEJ6pD0&execution=91191432-b396-4aa2-803d-1836c2a3c1a7&client_id=news_books_client&tab_id=4kTdWikXFKs&client_data=eyJydSI6Imh0dHA6Ly9sb2NhbGhvc3Q6NTAwMC9hdXRob3JpemUiLCJydCI6ImNvZGUiLCJzdCI6ImhxajlsZGFTZkVibktWMWV4MElsellCSGZQZHdYbyJ9
```

- **Issuer:** This request is sent by the browser to the Keycloak server at `localhost:8080`.

- **Purpose:** The purpose of this request is to authenticate the user. The payload includes `username`, `password`, and other session-related data like `session_code`, `execution`, and `client_id`. These parameters help Keycloak identify the ongoing authentication session and the specific client requesting authentication.

- **Expected Response:** If the credentials are correct, Keycloak will respond with a `302 Found` status code, redirecting the browser to the `redirect_uri` (which is the application at `localhost:5000`). This response also includes a temporary `code` that the application will exchange for tokens.

### Step 3: Redirect Back to Application with Authorization Code

After successful authentication, Keycloak redirects the user back to the client application with an authorization code.

**URL:**
```
http://localhost:5000/authorize?state=hqj9ldaSfEbnKV1ex0IlzYBHfPdwXo&session_state=deffcc11-5c20-4dc4-9d33-b792f1496549&iss=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2Frealms%2Fnews_books_realm&code=cc53a2ce-588d-48f5-a0f6-c173ce066af7.deffcc11-5c20-4dc4-9d33-b792f1496549.4939703e-8dce-4ea6-852b-21fd3dfaac69
```

- **Issuer:** This request is generated by Keycloak and sent to the client application running on `localhost:5000`.

- **Purpose:** The purpose of this request is to pass the authorization code (`code`) back to the client application. The client application will now use this code to request an access token from Keycloak.

- **Expected Response:** The client application at `localhost:5000` receives the code and then typically initiates a backend request to Keycloak to exchange the code for an access token, ID token, and possibly a refresh token.

### Step 4: Final Redirect and User Sees Welcome Page

**URL:**
```
http://localhost:5000/
```

- **Issuer:** The client application (running on `localhost:5000`) issues this request after handling the authorization code and possibly exchanging it for tokens.

- **Purpose:** This URL corresponds to the main page of the application, which is displayed after the user has successfully logged in. At this point, the application has verified the user’s identity using the tokens obtained from Keycloak.

- **Expected Response:** The application responds by rendering the welcome page, where the user might see personalized content (e.g., "Welcome, Mike").


### **Step 5: User Clicks "Fetch" Button and Requests Additional Resources**
- **URL:**
  ```
  http://localhost:5000/fetch_resources?
  ```
- **Request Method:** GET
- **Status Code:** 302 FOUND
- **Issuer:** The web application running on `localhost:5000` sends this request when the user clicks the "Fetch" button to retrieve additional resources from a microservice.
- **Purpose:** This request aims to fetch specific resources. However, the server responds with a `302 Found` status code, indicating a temporary redirect. This might happen due to a variety of reasons, such as the user not being authorized to access the resource directly or a need to process additional authentication.
- **Expected Response:** The server includes a `Location` header in the response, directing the client to a different URL, often signaling that further action is required before the resource can be accessed.

### **Step 6: Redirect to the Root URL Again After Resource Fetch**
- **URL:**
  ```
  http://localhost:5000/
  ```
- **Request Method:** GET
- **Status Code:** 200 OK
- **Issuer:** Following the `302 Found` redirect from the previous step, the browser automatically issues a new GET request to the URL specified in the `Location` header of the previous response, which in this case is the root URL again (`/`).
- **Purpose:** This step ensures the user is correctly redirected, possibly indicating a fallback mechanism or a re-validation step in the resource-fetching process.
- **Expected Response:** The server responds with the main HTML page or another resource depending on the application’s logic. The process might result in the display of a different page or reloading of the current page.


### **Overview of the Flow**

1. **Initial Login Request:** The user is directed from the application to the identity provider (Keycloak) to authenticate.
2. **Authentication:** Keycloak processes the login information and, upon success, generates an authorization code.
3. **Authorization Code Exchange:** The client application exchanges the authorization code for tokens, allowing it to manage user sessions securely.
4. **Main Application Page:** After successful authentication, the user is redirected back to the main application page, where they are now logged in.
5. **Fetching Resources:** The user initiates a resource fetch, which may involve further redirects or authentication checks.
6. **Final Redirect:** After the resource-fetching attempt, the user might be redirected back to the main page or another fallback URL, ensuring that the application flow remains consistent.
