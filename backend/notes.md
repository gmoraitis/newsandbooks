### A user path 
When user access my app: 
1. First step is that my app will goes to (/) route, and then
this route requires authorization,so redirects to /login.

2. Step two is login will redirect to authorization server which is KC.

3. After i am auth in (KC) i will (the user), redirect back to (/) 
which is displaying a plain html with a welcome message,
and a button to fetch resources from the microservise 
running on a different infrustructure.
